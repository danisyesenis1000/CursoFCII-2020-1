# Point 1

1. Contents:

 - **GuessNumberHeader.h**: Header file containing the definition of the class.

 - **GuessNumberMethods.cpp**: Definitions of methods related to the class defined above.

 - **GuessNumberExecution.cpp**: Code in which the final user interacts with the class.

2. Compilation: g++ GuessNumberExecution.cpp GuessNumberMethods.cpp -o GuessNumber.exe

3. Execution: ./GuessNumber.exe (*No command line arguments*)

4. **IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION**: All integers have been set to the type "unsigned short int", as a way to consume as few memory as possible. Therefore valid entries range from 0 to 65535. The algoritm for generating pseudorandom integers is different from the one explained in class.

5. For checking purposes: 

 - Change the values of "RuntimeLower" and "RuntimeUpper" declared in "GuessNumberExecution.cpp", in order to play the game with different bounds for the pseudorandom number generator.

 - If line 68 of "GuessNumberMethods.cpp" is uncommented, one is able to see the random number generated by the machine when executing the program, verifying the behaviour of inner "if-else" statements.
